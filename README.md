# ESP32_TempDevice
Created a small and simple temperature sensor using ESP32, DHT11 Temperature Sensor and a SSD1306 OLED Display.

**Prerequisites: ** I used Arduinos IDE to create the code and load it onto my ESP 32. Note that the Arduino IDE needs to Set up to load programs into the ESP 32 Microcontroller. I was able to find countless guides on Youtube to accomplish this. 

**Purpose:** I wanted to create a Temperature sensor device that I can place inside my PC and read the Temperature inside while in use. To accomplish this I decided to use a ESP 32 with Temperature and OLED Display.
